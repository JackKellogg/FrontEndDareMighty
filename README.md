# Dare Mighty Things Hackathon (November 2019)
## JLL Dataset
Query the database and comeup with a sales pitch for a roker to read and get some insights on the site they are trying to sell.

**Front-end** : ReactJS, HTML5, CSS3<br/>
**Back-end** : Python, Flask, NodeJS

We implemented a system where we query the test database we were given to us and come up with the different important information that was available.

To make it easier to query we added an autocomplete plugin to search the database. Then we improved our system to bring up other relavent information that was not present in the databse. To do this, we made use of the Google Places API and found out relavant areas nearby the place of interest and added it to the pitch. 

We were also able to put in a street view of the place using Google APIs to give a more immersive experience.

All this was done in under 14 hours by 4 people who never met before. It was a fun experience.
